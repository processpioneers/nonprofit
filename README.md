This is the central hub for all things related to "Evaluating the Engagement Equation: Where Mission Meets Data Utilization to Drive Nonprofit Decision-Making", a generalized systematic review registered in OSF Registires: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/B26NV - stick with me as I learn to navigate the land of open source.


**BACKGROUND**

Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) are the conductors of transformative social change, each initiative a unique note in a grand symphony of impact. However, the complexity of managing research and data practices often disrupts their harmony. While training resources for programming and IT are readily available, guidance on best practices for collecting, managing, and using data remains scarce.

Implementing robust research and data practices in the nonprofit sector is often hindered by unique challenges such as sector skepticism, practitioner anxiety, and reluctance to embrace advanced research methodologies and data-driven decision-making. These barriers, compounded by planning and funder requirements, underscore the need for systematic changes in how data and research are approached and supported within the sector.


**REVIEW METHODS**

**-Review Type:** Systematic literature review. Modeled after Tranfield, D., Denyer, D., & Smart, P. (2003). Towards a methodology for developing evidence‐informed management knowledge by means of systematic review. British journal of management, 14(3), 207-222.

**-Review Stages:** 1) Planning the Review (define scope, outline objectives, develop protocol), 2) Conducting the Review (identification of research, selection of studies, data extraction), and 3) Reporting and Dissemination (results and recommendations)

**-Current Review Stage:** Conducting the Review 

**-Start Date:** Database searches were completed on 01/02/2025

**-Anticipated End Date:** 01/31/2025

**-Primary Research Question(s):** 1) What are the primary barriers nonprofit organizations face when implementing robust research and data practices?, 2) What strategies can be employed to build organizational capacity for effective data collection, management, and utilization in nonprofits?, 3) What role do external factors (e.g., funders, coalitions, collaborations) play in supporting or hindering the development of research and data capabilities in nonprofits?, and 4) What are the key components of data literacy that nonprofit staff need to develop to effectively use data in decision-making?

**-Secondary research question(s):** By addressing these barriers and providing practical insights, this review advocates for a transformation in nonprofit research practices. It underscores the need for nonprofits to become proficient in data management and to adopt equitable research methodologies. This transformation is essential not only for the success and sustainability of individual organizations but also for the broader goal of advancing social justice and uplifting communities. 

**-Expectations:** The objective of this review is to systematically explore and address the multifaceted challenges and opportunities faced by nonprofit organizations in enhancing their research and data practices. This review aims to identify primary barriers to implementing robust research and data practices, identify capacity building strategies for data collection, management, and utilization, examine the roles of external factors (e.g., funders, coalitions, collaborations), and define key components of data literacy. By addressing these key areas, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding and actionable recommendations for enhancing the research and data practices of nonprofit organizations, thereby improving their overall effectiveness and capacity to fulfill their missions.

**SEARCH STRATEGY**

**-Databases:** ScienceDirect, Sage Publishing

**-Interfaces:** Elsevier, Sage Publishing

**-Grey literature:** Google Scholar will identify grey literature

**-Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:** The overall objective of this review is to understand the current state of nonprofit-based research, covering the main obstacles that nonprofit organizations encounter when implementing robust research and data practices (e.g., resource limitations, cultural resistance, stringent funder requirements, fluctuating funding streams), effective strategies for building organizational capacity for data collection, management, and utilization (e.g., training programs, data management systems, data-driven organizational culture), the role that funders play in supporting or hindering the development of research and data capabilities, the essential components of data literacy needed to effectively use data in decision-making (e.g., skills, knowledge areas, training), and the benefits coalitions and cross-sector collaborations bring to nonprofit research practices, along with best practices for forming and maintaining effective partnerships. Additionally, the review critically examines the key theories, models, and frameworks for ensuring that community voices and needs guide research agendas and data practices from the outset. 

**-Query Strings:** ScienceDirect ("data literacy" AND "nonprofit" OR "non profit" OR "non-profit" OR "not for profit" OR "not-for-profit" AND "research" AND "community"), ScienceDirect ("nonprofit" OR "non profit" OR "non-profit" OR "not for profit" OR "not-for-profit" AND “data practice" OR “data management" OR "data needs" OR "data capacity"), ScienceDirect ("nonprofit" OR "non profit" OR "non-profit" OR "not for profit" OR "not-for-profit" AND "program evaluation" OR "performance management" OR "needs assessment" AND "barrier"), and SageJournals ("nonprofit")

**-Search Validation Procedure:** Identify appropriate databases and keywords, Generate search strings and define inclusion and exclusion criteria, Conduct extensive database searches using specific search terms and strings, Screen titles and abstracts to locate potential papers, Review the full text of potential papers against the inclusion and exclusion criteria, Search included articles for additional relevant citations, and Extract relevant data from the final sample of articles.

First, databases and keywords were identified, informing search string generation and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Next, extensive searches were conducted in the identified databases using the specific search terms and strings. Once all potential papers were located within each database, duplicate articles were identified and removed. Next, titles and abstracts were screened using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. These criteria are designed to ensure potential studies remain relevant to the stated research objectives. Articles passing through Title/Abstract review moved to Full Text review, again applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles meeting all specific inclusion criteria were retained. The reference sections of articles deemed appropriate for inclusion were scanned for additional relevant articles. Once the final sample of articles was achieved, data extraction began. To reduce human error and bias, a form containing general article information (e.g., title, year of publication, country of origin), study features (e.g., type, data collection methods, focus), and information relevant to the research questions (theories, organization characteristics, participants, services offered) was used (Transfield et al., 2003). 

**-Other Search Strategies:** Filters for publication date (2014-2025), language (English only), and access type (open access only) were applied to all searches. The “Open Access & Open archive” filter was chosen strategically to reflect the real-life experiences of nonprofit organizations who may not have access to scholarly databases. Exclusion criteria: Papers published prior to 2014, Papers not published in peer-reviewed journals, Studies conducted outside of the Western-context, prioritizing the United States, Studies determined as outside of scope (e.g., nonprofit focus, relevant to U.S. context, data-focused)

**-Procedures to Contact Authors:** Using the "Template 6_SpecificDataRequest" found at the link referenced, I will send emails to the point of contact listed on the article, following up a total of two times. All progress will be tracked in Github. I will report the data as any other outcome, treating it like any other response rate. 

**-Search Expiration and Repetition:** I completed initial concept work in this area back in July of 20224. The present review is based on all that prep work, therefore repetition will not be necessary for my purposes

**-Search Strategy Justification:** Two well-known databases, ScienceDirect and Sage Journals, were selected for their relevance to the field, comprehensive coverage, credibility, peer-reviewed standards, accessibility, and advanced search capabilities. ScienceDirect is known for its extensive collection of peer-reviewed literature, particularly in social sciences, business, and organizational studies, making it highly relevant to research on NPOs. Sage Journals specializes in social sciences and humanities, offering a rich repository of research focused on organizational behavior, management practices, and data handling within the nonprofit sector. Together, these databases cover a vast array of journals that publish research related to data practices, management, and organizational studies, ensuring a thorough review. Both ScienceDirect and Sage Journals are reliable and reputable sources for peer-reviewed publications, thus ensuring the integrity and reliability of this review. Additionally, both databases are equipped with advanced search functionalities, allowing for precise filtering and retrieval of relevant articles, which is essential for conducting a comprehensive and focused review. Lastly, ScienceDirect and Sage Journals contain both historical and contemporary research, enabling the tracking of trends over time and the identification of emerging issues. Keywords, related terms and synonyms were identified using the aforementioned research questions to generate search queries. In June & July 2024, five separate searches were conducted in ScienceDirect and Sage Journals databases using specific keywords. In Sage Journals, searches targeting nonprofits overall and funder roles were performed. Searches focusing on data literacy, barriers, and data practices were conducted in ScienceDirect. 

**-Miscellaneous Details:** The “Open Access content only” filter was chosen strategically to reflect the real-life experiences of nonprofit organizations who may not have access to scholarly databases. 


**SCREENING**

**-Screening Stages:** Screening the literature involved selecting papers and extracting data. Full citation ris files were uploaded in the Rayyan platform based on searches performed. Duplicate removal was completed by a computer supervised by a human. At this phase, of the 5,5052 references uploaded, 1,610 were determined to be duplicates and not carried to the screening phase. Reference collection is still ongoing. Titles and abstracts were screened based on publication year, country, and scope. Only articles published between 2014 and 2024 were considered to ensure only the most recent contemporary research conducted in the field was included. Choosing a reference period of the last decade seemed the most appropriate, unbiased approach. Only articles published in English were considered due to the strict academic standards guaranteed by the peer review process. Although the focus of the review is on the U.S. nonprofit landscape, research conducted in comparable Western-cultures was considered for inclusion on a case-by-case basis. Studies missing content relating to the research questions (listed below in miscellaneous) or NPOs and their data use in general were excluded. Vetting potential articles through these inclusion and exclusion criteria facilitated a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the data use in the nonprofit sector. Next, a full-text review further narrows the pool to a final sample of articles deemed appropriate for study inclusion. Using the data extraction form alluded to earlier, relevant data points were pulled from each article, including the country of origin, article type (i.e., case study, conceptual, empirical, review), study type (i.e., qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods), data collection methods, focus area, theory, organization characteristics, participant traits, and service or content information.

**-Blinding:** Blinding is used to minimize bias. When blinding is on in Rayyan, decisions, labels and notes will not be visible to other collaborators as part of the effort to minimize risk of bias.

**-Used Criteria:** Inclusion Criteria (1- Barriers to research and data practices, 2 - Data collection, management, and utilization strategies, 3 - External factors influence, 4 - Data literacy components) and Exclusion Criteria (1 - Not relevant to U.S. context, 2 - No mention of data practices, management, capacity, or needs, 3 - Nonprofit relevance is only as study setting)

**-Screener Instructions:** Keyword filters provide a visual guide for reviewing each article. "Keywords for include" appear in green highlighted text, examples of keywords are "data management", "non profit", and "data capacity". "Keywords for exclude" appear simultaneously in red text, examples of keywords are "Africa", "Italian", and "UK". PICO filters for Population, Intervention, Outcome are also available for selection, with filter options being those preloaded in the Rayyan platform. Articles are given a dichotomous YES/No approach to inclusion at this phase, with yes indicating include to full text and no meaning exclude.  The exact reasons listed in the Rayyan platform to select when EXCLUDING: Not relevant to U.S. context, No relevance to nonprofit sector, Nonprofit relevance is only as study setting, and No mention of data practices. An article that is excluded can be given the label "Review for background" to inform other parts of the paper. 

**-Screening Reliability:** There is only one screener at this time, myself. 

**-Screening Reconciliation Procedure:** Not applicable at this time. 

**-Sampling:** All studies identified at this stage are kept. 

**-Screening Procedure Justification:** There is only a single reviewer at this time.

**EXTRACTION**

**-Entities:** To reduce human error and bias, a form containing general article information (e.g., title, year of publication, country of origin), study features (e.g., type, data collection methods, focus), and information relevant to the research questions (theories, organization characteristics, participants, services offered) was used (Transfield et al., 2003). 

**-Extraction Stages:** Findings are detailed in a descriptive quantitative analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis to present a comprehensive reporting of the literature. The descriptive analysis summarized and categorized articles quantitatively, meaning no inferences were made beyond the data itself. The quantitative analysis examined each article's country of origin, type, study method, data collection methods, sample characteristics, and focus area using predetermined categories. The thematic analysis served the purpose of inference, allowing patterns to emerge from the data.
